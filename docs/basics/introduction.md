# Introduction

## Services

Within Altais, we have several services that are worth knowing. It is possible that you do not have access to all of them. If you feel you should have access, let me know. Also give us an echo when you think some kind of service would suit us.

::: tip USERNAME
Use **one username** for all services. It can be arbitrary, as long as it does not conflict with another username, but remember one and the same name everywhere.
