# WindiCSS

> [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/) is a next generation utility-first CSS framework.

The idea is that you should not use ready components for your project like you would in eg. Bootstrap, but rather use a convenient set of utilities. That is why this Windi is called _utility-first framework_. It may not be pleasant at first glance, but soon the advantages are becoming more and more clear.

## TailwindCSS

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is the biggest rival of Windi. Since Tailwind have a lot of learning resources, so it is suggested to use their tutorials to learn it. Windi is also 100% compatible, so do not worry. You can also use Tailwind docs instead of Windi one.

Why use Windi instead of Tailwind? There were [some problems](https://antfu.me/posts/windicss-and-tailwind-jit) with the new JIT compiler for Tailwind. In short, they stolen some great ideas from Windi and did not talked about it. Also, the Windi has better features, brings them faster and is much easier to configure with Vite.
