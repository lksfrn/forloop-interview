# `forloop-interview`

## Things to consider

- little time for the demo development
- no ESlint, Prettier, Git hooks, tests...
- based on superfast Vite
- deployed to Vercel with CI/CD
- Emotion used for styling
- memoization kills first node that is added
- data on the board left intentionally
- some issues with the positioning of nodes
